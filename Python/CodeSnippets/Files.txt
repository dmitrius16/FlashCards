===== Work with file

function - open() 
mode parameter:
'r' - Open for reading. If the file doesn't exist, an error occurs.
'w' - Open for writing and truncate. If the file already exists, it will be overwtitten.
'a' - Open for writing. If the file aready exists, append to the end of the file.
'+' - Open for updating (reading and writing)
't' - Open as a text

default mode is 'r' or more precisely 'rt'
==== encoding 
The encoding parameter specifies the encoding that should be used to decode or encode the text file.
The default value depends on the platform.

#UTF - 8 
file_utf8 = open('my_file.txt', encoding='utf-8')

#UTF - 16
file_utf16 = open('my_file.txt', encoding='utf-16')

#CP1252
file_cp1252 = open('my_file.txt', encoding='CP1252')

==== Reading files in python
- read(size) - read size bytes of file. If the parameter isn't specified, the whole file is read into a
single variable

- readline(size) - is similar to read(size) but it reads size bytes from a simgle line, not the whole file.

- readlines() - allows us to read the whole file as a list of lines.

============ read using for loop
file = open('animals.txt', 'r')
for line in file:
    print(line)


=========Contex manager keyword = with !!!
with open("test.txt", 'r') as f:
    for l in f:
        print(l)

// read and write
with open('tarantino.txt', 'r', encoding='utf-8') as in_file, \
     open('tarantino_lowercase.txt', 'w', encoding='utf-8') as out_file:
    for line in in_file:
        out_file.write(line.lower())
