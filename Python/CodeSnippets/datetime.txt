The datetime module has several classes that make working with time easy:

datetime.date - represents standard date;
datetime.time - represents standard time, independent from the date;
datetime.timedelta - represents the difference between two points in time;
datetime.tzinfo - represents timezones;
datetime.datetime - represents both time and date together.

The constructor of the datetime.datetime objects takes the following parameters:
import datetime

datetime.datetime(year, month, day, hour=0, minute=0, second=0, microsecond=0, tzinfo=None)
