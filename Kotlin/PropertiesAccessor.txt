class Client {
    val name = "Unknown"
}

val client = Client()

Suppose we want to get value of property name:

    println(client.name)
    
In fact, when you want to get the value of some property, you call a special
get() function called getter. This is what actually look like:

class Client {
    val name = "Unknown"
        get() {
            return field
        }
}

or with ommited curly brackets 

class Client {
    val name = "Unknown"
    get() = field
}

In this case, getter just returns the value of the name variable. This is the expected
behavior, so Kotlin generates this function for us. YOU DON'T NEED TO WRITE IT!
