1. readText

    First, there is readText() which helps you read the whole file in just one String variable
    
    Say we create a text file reading.txt with the following text: 
        
        Kotlin or Java, 
        Java or C++.
        
        We put it in src folder, and now we can read it with our readText method:
           
        val fileName = "src/reading.txt"
        val lines = File(fileName).readText()
        print(lines)
        
        we also can create reference to File variable:
        
        val file = File(fileName)
        val lines = file.readText()
        
        readText - automatically opened and closed the file !!!
        
        val line = File(fileName).readText(Charsets.US_ASCII)
        
        Just keep in mind tha by default readText() has UTF-8 charset encoding
        
        DON'T USE THIS FUNCTION WITH FILES LARGER THAN 2 Gb -> it can cause OutOfMemoryError.
        
        We can also check the existence of a file with exists() method.
