Here must be block theory about for in range

for (i in 1..10)

for (i in 10 downTo 1) //backward order


for (i in 1 until 10) //excluding the upper limit

for (i in 1..7 step 2) // specifying step

Iterating through an array:

    Suppose we have an array with days of a week. Let's print each days

    fun main() {
        val daysOfWeek = arrayOf("Sun", "Mon", "Tues", "Wed", "Thur", "Fri", "Sat")

        for (day in daysOfWeek) {
            printLn(day)
        }
    }

    This program prints:
    Sun
    Mon
    Tues
    Wed
    Thur
    Fri
    Sat

Iterating through array by indices
    See above for defenition daysOfWeek

    for(index in daysOfWeek.indices) {
        printLn("$index: ${daysOfWeek[index]})
    }
