Tuple:

Select 'Alice', 170, 170 * 0.393701;

Alias

Select 'Alice' as name, 
        170 as heigh_in_centimeters,
        170 * 0.393701 as "heigh in inches"

In a query you may specify a name(alias) for each attribute of a tuple.
To do so, you should use a keyword AS followed by a name for the value.
If the attribute alias consists of several words or matches an SQL keyword, 
it should be stated in double-quotes.

Here is template for a basic SELECT statement:

SELECT val1 [AS name1],..., valN [AS nameN];
