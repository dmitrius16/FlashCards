Let's imagine that your first client wants to buy a good book by Charles Dickens for a friend
who speaks French and English. Let's write a query that selects books that meet the criteria:

SELECT
    id, 
    title, 
    author,
    language,
    rating,
    price,
    amount
FROM
    books
WHERE
    author = 'Charles Dickens'
    AND (language = 'EN' OR language = 'FR')
    AND rating > 4.0
    AND amount > 0
    ;
