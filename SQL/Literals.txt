String literals - sequence of characters surrounded by single(') or double(").
    Examples: 'Hyperskill', "SQL (Structured query language)"
    To include a single-quote character within a string-literal, type two adjacent single quotes.
    'Jessie''s birthday'

Numeric literals - can be either positive or negative numbers specified as integer(for example, 1, +9000, -256)
    ,decimal(for example, 2.3, +876.234, -1024.0), or real values in exponential notation (0.4e3, +7.192834e+10)


We can directly specify the type of a literal using the CAST (value AS type) function.
Examples: CAST(1 AS DECIMAL(20,3)), CAST(123.4 AS INTEGER),

        select CAST(256 as DECIMAL(10,2))

Boolean literals
