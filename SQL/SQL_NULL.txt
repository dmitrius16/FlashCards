NULL value basically means "could be anything". Because of this, comparisons with NULL
can never result in either TRUE or FALSE, but always in a third logical result, UNKNOWN.

UNKNOWN is, actually, the NULL value of boolean type and some data management systems do not
distinguish a special UNKNOWN value.

For example, the result of each of the following comparisons is UNKNOWN:
NULL = 1
NULL <> 1
NULL > 1
NULL = '1'
NULL = NULL

SQL support special predicates for that: IS NULL and IS NOT NULL

SELECT 0+NULL is NULL; --> TRUE

SELECT '' is NOT NULL; --> TRUE

SELECT NULL IS NOT NULL; --> FALSE

SELECT 1-1 IS NULL; --> FALSE
